What I did yesterday:
	- I didn't do much yesterday as most of my time was spent on installing the React App.
	- I also made a GitHub repo, linked it with my folder.
	- Watched the given videos, not all of them but most.
	- Followed up on most of the links that were shared yesterday but the lecturer and some students on learning React.

What challenges did I face yesterday:
	- Installing the app was very difficult because It gave me many errors.
	- Uhm yeah that's about it i think.
	
What are my plans and goals for today:
	- I want to play around with the app, for comfortability first.
	- Once I'm comfortable then I can start with the project because I don't want any problems this time around.
